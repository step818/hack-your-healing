# _Hack Your Healing_

#### By _**Stephen Trewick**_

## Program Name _Hack Your Healing_ Epicodus Final Project

## Description

This exercise is designed to demonstrate a website created with the React library. The website demonstrates my abilities using React and other technologies and resources.

The theme of the site is a holistic healing/hippie services site for users to get a variety of services. There will be a yoga schedule, a page for making a appointment for a massage/acupuncture/etc., and an online store with the option to buy tea, candles, etc.

 When complete, the website will have the following:

|_**'Schedule'**_ page that can be updated my admin, and automatically clears each event when the time passes. |
|_**'Store'**_ page that users can sign in, add to a shopping cart, and purchase items|
|_**'Appointment'**_ page that a user can schedule themselves for a massage or similar service|
